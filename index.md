Hello everyone!

My name is Pedro, and I am a brazilian software engineer with knowledge of both backend and frontend software development. 

Familiar with several programming languages and frameworks, I have been working most of the time with PHP and Javascript, using Laravel and Vue JS frameworks. 

I am organized and highly committed with product quality, and always keep myself updated with the most recent technologies. 

In my free time, I like to learn new things (technology stuff) and play music.
